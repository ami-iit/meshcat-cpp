# - Finds zmq.hpp
#
# A CMake variable or environment variable named CPPZMQ_DIR may be used to
# provide an explicit location. (If both are set, the CMake variable takes
# precedence.)
#
# The following variables are set if zmq.hpp is found:
#
#   CPPZMQ_FOUND        - Set to TRUE
#   CPPZMQ_LIBRARIES    - The name of an INTERFACE IMPORTED target.
#   CPPZMQ_INCLUDE_DIRS - The directory which contains zmq.hpp.  This is also
#                         added as a dependency to the INTERFACE IMPORTED
#                         target.
#
# If zmq.hpp is not found, CPPZMQ_FOUND is set to false.
